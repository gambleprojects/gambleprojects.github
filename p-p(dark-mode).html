    <p class="wrapper">Pablo Picasso is one of the most renowned artists of all time. His unique artistic ability attracted people from all over the globe and it is still having effects on people today. Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in the year of 1881, years later he moved to France, which is where he would live for most of his adult life. He lived until 1973, that made him 91 years old in the year of his death. During his lifetime he created more than 20,000 works of art, including paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, and other artistic items.

    <p class="wrapper">Picasso was introduced to art very early on in life; his father (Don José Ruiz y Blasco) was an artist and a professor of art. His father was impressed with his drawing from an early age and he began teaching his son how to create oil paintings and drawings when Picasso was seven. After his years of studying with his father at home Picasso (at the age of 13) decided to attend the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona which is where his father taught him more intensely. Later, Picasso decided to go to Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, which at the time was Spain’s top art academy. Picasso did not attend long, because he preferred to visit art exhibits there rather than go to any classes. During this unique period of his life, he was still painting and creating art that may render some speechless.

    <p class="wrapper">During the year 1900, Picasso decided to go to Paris, which was the center of European art, but things did not go as expected. He decided to move in with a man named Max Jacob, who was a poet and journalist, but poverty struck and it was so brutal that they were even forced to burn some of Picasso’s paintings just to stay warm. In 1901 Picasso relocated to Madrid, Spain. During his time there he decided to sign his artwork as Picasso rather than is customary name “Pablo Ruiz y Picasso.”

    <p class="wrapper">Picasso had different periods in his life where he did art differently than the next period. The first was dubbed the “Blue Period”, because he used mostly blue and a few accent colors here and there. Some historians attribute the Blue Period to Picasso having depression, after one of his friends committed suicide. Some of his art consisted of melancholy things such as poverty and blindness. During his lifetime he had many other artistic periods such as: the “Rose Period”, the “African Influence” period, and much more.

    <p class="wrapper">Picasso had and still has one of the biggest and most important effects on art and graphic design. His unique ability to transform what he saw in various styles into one completely different style and entirely change the way people looked at something is something that has changed the way people view art. Picasso’s unique style of art is still used and admired today and will be admired for years to come.
