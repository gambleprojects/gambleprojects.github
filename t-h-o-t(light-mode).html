    <p class="wrapper">The history of "modern" technology is a very broad term, because most things we use every day is technology. Thigs like a watch, or a car, or even something as simple as the wheel are all examples of technology, but the technology that will be discussed in this article is computer-based technology. The First computers could do nothing more than some of the most elementary mathematical equations and in order to do that it took up entire rooms, but now we can everything that it could plus a lot more with a device that fits in the palm of your hand. It is truly remarkable what we have been able to do in the time we have done it, but do we really know where it came from? Do we know how we got from there to where we are today? In this article, I will explain in detail how we did it, who did it, and why it was done.

<p class="wrapper">As stated in the paragraph above the original computers where gigantic machines invented for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to do very simple mathematical equations. The very first “programable”, all-electronic computer to do so was a machine called the “Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer” or “ENIAC” for short. It was invented during World War Two by a team lead by John Mauchly, and J. Presper Eckert Jr., and their peers at the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. The project was funded by the United States of America’s government, therefore the project members where put under contract with the army. The team was under the command of the American engineer Herman Goldstine. The project started in 1943. “ENIAC” was able to communicate through plugboards. A plugboard is an area on a computer where there is a series of jacks, or sockets (also referred to as hubs), where the user is able to plug in specialized devices to “program” the machine. “ENIAC” was the most powerful calculating devise of its time, but it was also ginormous it took up took up the 50-by-30-foot basement of the Moore School. After the machine was finished in 1946 (about three years after the starting point), it was supposed to help win the war, but the war had already finished, so its first job was doing calculations to help build the hydrogen bomb.

<p class="wrapper">Many people had the idea of a “worldwide network” or, as it is more commonly known, the internet for decades before we even had the technology to make it remotely feasible. It was not until the late 1960’s that we even had a prototype of what would later be called the internet. It was called “Advanced Research Projects Agency Network” or “ARPANET” for short. It allowed multiple computers to run off one designated network. People started to use “ARPANET” as the fundamental starting point for something more than a few computers using one network. They wanted something bigger. They started building it piece by piece, until we have what we know and love today the internet! It was not until the 1990’s that the internet really became a big deal, when the “World Wide Web” or “www” was created by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. Many people think that the “Worldwide Web” is the internet, but that is not true. The “World Wide Web” is just how we access websites and hyperlinks. Thanks to all these ideas and inventions we have the internet.

<p class="wrapper">Although computers and the internet are something that we as Americans use almost every day it is not to be taken for granted. It is important to see how they where created so we know what to do and what not to do. It also help us make innovations on what has already been built and create what no one has thought of.
